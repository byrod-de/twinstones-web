# Privacy Statement

We care about your privacy. This bot only collects what it needs to function properly and avoid chaos.

## What We Collect
- **Usernames**: For logging who ran what command (helps with moderation and debugging). These are deleted after 24 hours.
- **Guild IDs**: To know where the bot is being used.
- **Timestamps**: So we know when something happened, especially when something breaks. These are deleted after 24 hours.
- **Roll results**: Anonymously, for fun stats and fancy graphs.

## Why We Collect It
- To make the bot work reliably.
- To troubleshoot issues.
- To prevent abuse.

We do **not** collect message contents from users or servers on which the bot is used. We do not track users across servers, or sell any data.

## How Long We Keep It
- Logs are kept only as long as needed to diagnose problems or improve features.
- We aim for short retention and regular cleanup.

## Your Rights
If you're in the EU or similar regions, you can:
- Ask what data (if any) we have on you.
- Request we delete it.
- Ask questions about how we handle your data.

To do any of that, just contact the developer. We'll do our best to help.

**TL;DR**: We log as little as possible, don’t misuse it, and will delete it on request.
